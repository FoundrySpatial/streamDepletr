# streamDepletr
An R package with tools for assessing the impacts of groundwater pumping on wells.

**Tools are in 3 general categories:**
- Analytical streamflow depletion models
- Depletion apportionment equations
- Baseflow separation functions (currently these are in a different repository - still deciding whether they should be part of this package or not)
