Title: Estimate Streamflow Depletion Due to Groundwater Pumping
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Description: Implementation of analytical models for estimating streamflow 
    depletion due to groundwater pumping, and other related tools. Functions
    are broadly split into two groups: (1) analytical streamflow depletion
    models, which estimate streamflow depletion for a single stream reach
    resulting from groundwater pumping; and (2) depletion apportionment 
    equations, which distribute estimated streamflow depletion among multiple
    stream reaches within a stream network. See Zipper et al. (2018) <doi:10.1029/2018WR022707>
    for more information on depletion apportionment equations and Zipper et
    al. (2019) <doi:10.31223/osf.io/uqbd7> for more information on analytical
    depletion functions, which combine analytical models and depletion apportionment
    equations.
