Title: Estimate Streamflow Depletion due to Groundwater Pumping
Version: 0.1.0
Description: Implementation of analytical models for estimating streamflow 
    depletion due to groundwater pumping, and other related tools. Functions
    are broadly split into two groups: (1) analytical streamflow depletion
    models, which estimate streamflow depletion for a single stream reach
    resulting from groundwater pumping; and (2) depletion apportionment 
    equations, which distribute estimated streamflow depletion among multiple
    stream reaches within a stream network.
